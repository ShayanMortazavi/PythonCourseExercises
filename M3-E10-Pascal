Pascal's triangle
-----------------
Using a while loop.

Pascal's triangle is an equilateral triangle of numbers in which each number is
the same of the two numbers above it.  For example, the first five rows are:

            1
           1 1
          1 2 1
         1 3 3 1
        1 4 6 4 1

Using while loops and/or for loops, generate the first 20 rows of Pascal's
triangle and store in a list of lists.

You may need to use if statements too.

Remember list indices are zero-based!

BONUS EXERCISE:
Can you find and print the largest number in the triangle?
